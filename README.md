Hi, this is my site that has some links to my things, and eventually maybe I'll host cool projects on here.

This site is pretty much static for now.

Theres a service worker to cache the site so that it works offline.
I'm trying to keep it as accesible as possible.
Theres also a webappmanifest so that its considered a PWA, although I don't know why anyone would want to install this on their phone lol.

Some things in the future I see for this is:
* Fun Styling
* Favicon
* More links
